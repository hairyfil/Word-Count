This is a text file with text in it.
It is used to test a program that counts the number of words
then if you have time you can count the number of words and create
an index which tabulates each word and how many times it is used.
As an extension to that you can then create a dictionary of lists that has 
the format of {'Word': (list of where the word is found)}
